        "answer": "Power means acceleration. Basic mechanics. More power means wider windows for passing other cars for instance. Also means better acceleration even when loaded (with more people or stuff).\n\nTorque is rotational momentum, it means how much force the car can actually exert. It helps with accelerating from stop, and with heavy loads while the RPMs of the engine are low. Example: a tractor doesn't\ngenerally needs that much power but needs a lot of torque to pull heavy stuff across bad terrain.\n\nBigger number of cyllinders and volume says the car can take more gas in and produce more power or torque but that is very rough generalization, depends on other efficiency factors.\n\nThe engine generally exerts more power at higher RPMs which is usable for serious racing accelerations but the engine needs to be mechanically able to withstand that.\n\nFront/rear drive is normal, mechanically simple deal. Getting all-wheel drive is complicated but enables better performance on rough terrain or snow where single wheels might not have enough contact with the ground to have sufficient friction.\n\nSuspension \"cushions\" the drive to uneven surface and secondly affects power efficiency and handlig. Multiple factors here, but main purpose is protect the car from shocks.\n\nSize of wheels relates to force momentum and torque.\n\nQuestions?",

Historically, whenever there has been a recession or a famine, xenophobia has risen.\n\nWhen things are going well, good jobs are plentiful, and opportunity abounds, nobody really cares about people of different ethnicities and lifestyles. There's a perception that even if people are making the wrong choices, there's plenty to go around.\n\nBut, when things get bad, people start to wonder why. On an instinctive level, we don't understand the economy as it is (an interconnected, flowing exchange of goods and services) but understand it in a more primeval way, like a harsh winter making fewer berries and less game in the valley. So, we look to the other tribes, and feel that we'd have more if they went away. But don't worry, as soon as the Baby Boomers are able to retire and college grads once again find middle class jobs, it'll all go back to normal.\n\nIn other words, the human race just really needs a Snickers right now.",

They didn't cool enough between pulses to stop glowing) . Some kinds of fluorescents flicker slowly enough that some people *do* notice it, and it can actually give them headaches.\n\nThis is also very closely related to *persistence of vision*, which is the behavior that lets us see apparent motion from the still images that make up a movie.",

To make the math easy let's say Wisconsin was worth 100 delegates and had 10 congressional districts all worth 10 delegates each. If Bernie were to win every single one of those districts by a margin of 52-48 each district would have to set their delegate allotment at 5.2 delegates for Bernie, and 4.8 for Hillary. You can't award a fraction of a delegate, so what happens is that they would round, and both candidates would earn 5 delegates. Netting the overall delegate for the state 50/50 for both, despite Bernie getting 52% of the vote. It's a tiny difference, and this an extreme example showing all the rounding going in favor of one candidate. Usually it's going to be pretty dead on, but this is an example of how you can get a small disparity between your overall vote and the delegates you receive.",

        "question": "how can a Kingdom become an Empire? Or vice versa",
        "question_ctx": "",
        "answer": "If you are asking about formal requirements that really depends in what area of the and the culture we're talking about. Outside of the Western/European tradition the titles can be confusing and I don't think there really is a proper \"emperor\" other than the \"high king\" meaning \"king over other kings\" as in the Middle Eastern or Asian traditions. The actual term \"Emperor\" is pretty unique to Western culture.  For example Mongols had *khans* and \"great khans\". India had *rajas* (rulers of a *raj* - a kingdom) and *maha*rajas.\n\nIn reality as most things in politics it is due to some tradition. If you are interested read on:\n\n----\n\nEmperor comes from the Latin word \"Imperator\" which translates roughly into \"ruler of men\". Ancient Rome had two concepts describing relationships of power : imperium and dominium. Dominium was the rule over inanimate objects, wealth, land, slaves. This is where *dominus* and *domina* come from. This is why Christians address God \"Dominus\" and not \"Imperator\" - because Christian God is the lord of creation. This is also where the word \"dominatrix\" comes from - as a bastardized feminine version of \"domina\". Imperium was the rule over men and the title \"Imperator\" was given to a leader of Roman legions, also as a honorific after receiving a triumphs. For example after his campaign in Gaul Ceasar was the \"Imperator of the Gallic Legions\".  The Roman Emperors never used the title \"emperor\" formally until very very late - when Rome was turned into a proper monarchy called \"dominate\" (late 4th century AD). And even then the title was \"Augustus\" or - previously - \"Princeps\" (First). That's the explanation where the word comes from. \n\nThe difference between a king and an emperor is slightly more than just ceremonial. In the European tradition *a* king was a ruler that was a sovereign confirmed by the Catholic church. If you wanted to be a king you had to have enough land and subjects and influence and power so that the pope would agree to proclaim you a king and legitimize your right to rule.  You could style yourself a \"king\" in your own language if that was your custom but you wouldn't be *the* king unless you converted to Christianity and accepted the religious primacy of the Roman church and - depending on the political circumstances - political primacy of the Roman Emperor. The word for \"king\" in Latin was *rex* and was derived from  the word *regnum* which translates into \"kingdom\" but which literally means \"dominion, rule, domain\".  This is why in Latin a king is \"rex\" but a queen regnant is \"regina\".\n\nIn other words an emperor is the ruler of men while a king is just a ruler of a given domain (of land etc) and that's how it was in Christendom for most of the middle ages.\n\n----\n\n*The* emperor was initially only one - Roman Emperor - who ruled over Roman Empire which at the time was Christian by decree. The things started getting complicated when the Catholic church started dividing - because monarchical rule was at the time very dependent on divine mandate - god saying that you are the rightful ruler and people should obey you.  \n\nFirst it was the creation of Orthodox churches in opposition to Roman Catholic Church. That allowed for two \"popes\" (the Pope and the Patriarch) and two \"emperors\" after Rome split into two with emperors in Rome and Constantinople.  \n\nWhen Rome fell in 476 soon  the Roman tradition was being moved partly through Frankish kings in the Merovingian dynasty up to the re-birth of the Roman Empire (this time in name only) under Charlemagne. Then one of his sons got the title and moved on to create the Holy Roman Empire in the Frankish kingdoms which now are called Germany. The title of the Holy Roman Emperor over time became a semi-hereditary title supported by the electors The last Holy Roman Emperor was a Habsburg and had the capital in Vienna until 1806.\n\nSo for a very long time in the Christian/European sphere of influence there were only two \"emperors\". The Holy Roman Emperor (*Imperator Romanorum* of the *Imperium Sacrum Romanum* - all in Latin because that was the former Western Empire) and the Byzantine emperor called in Greek (becuase that was the Eastern Empire) *Basileus* (after Byzantium moved to Greek as the official language in 620, before he was *Augustus* in Latin).\nThere were two emperors because each one of them claimed the legacy and legitimacy of the \"original\" Roman emperor. Byzantium wasn't really called \"Byzantium\" at the time - it was \"Roman Empire\" (*Basilea Romaina* in Greek) and technically it had the capital of \"proper\" Rome since it was moved there by emperor Constantine in 3rd century AD ( Hence Constantinople - the city of Constantine). The political schism really came about as a result of the religious nature of the ruling mandate. Since Rome still was the seat of Catholic church and the pope they claimed the right to nominate emperors while patriarchs in Constantinople did the same. Since they couldn't really claim \"regular\" Roman Empire  since the final fall of Rome in 476 they reclaimed \"Holy\" Roman Empire within the new Christian sphere of influence in the West.\n\nThis lasted until 1453 when Ottomans conquered Constantinople. Then the seat of the Orthodox church moved to Russia and the Russian *Tsar* titled himself an \"emperor\" and Moscow - the new seat of the Orthodox church - became the \"third Rome\". They maintained the tile of Tsar until Peter the Great who rejected many Russian/Eastern/Asiatic traditions and decided to modernize his country and took to styling himself \"Emperor of Russia\". Again at the time there were two emperors both claiming religious mandate - the Holy Roman Emperor in Vienna backed by the Roman Catholic church and the Pope and the Emperor in Russia backed by the Orthodox Church and the Patriarch of Moscow.  \n\n----\n\nThen came the French Revolution and the legitimization of power moved from divine mandate to will of the people (or something) and Napoleon Bonaparte called himself *The Emperor of the French* (Notice: not of France. Remember what I wrote earlier about kings and emperors, imperium and dominium ). When he defeated Austria he also forced the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire and the abdication of the Holy Roman Emperor into an *Austrian Emperor* because Bonaparte saw himself as continuing the traditions of Charlemagne who in his opinion was both French and the rightful *Emperor*. \n\nAfter that all bets were off and people went out styling themselves \"Emperor\" quite openly. Napoleon III called himself Emperor and the France under his rule an Empire. Germany got an Emperor who was just a king before unification. Austria maintained an Emperor. Russia had an Emperor following reforms of Peter the Great.   Britain had an Emperor outside of traditional domains (India). Naturally the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire was styled \"Emperor\" too. Suddenly everyone could be an emperor if they had the army to back it up.\n\nThat's when \"empire\" became what we know today - a huge political entity comprising many nations and states often with their own rulers who are subject to some degree to another ruler (the emperor). That's why the USSR was considered informally an \"empire\" and why today we speak of \"American empire\".\n\n----\n\n**TL;DR**  \n\nOriginally the titles \"emperor\" and \"king\" had proper meaning within the domain of the Roman Catholic church. An Emperor was the political leader of all Christendom while Kings were just sovereign rulers of portions of land with some limited general sovereignty over local feudal lords.  It lasted for as long as Holy Roman Empire lasted and it was meant to emulate the ancient Roman political order.\n\nThen the French revolution came and after it Napoleon Bonaparte who considered himself a better \"emperor\" than the traditional emperor in Vienna. He proclaimed himself as one but didn't force the original emperor to abdicate the full title (just the \"Roman\" part which was annoying to Bonaparte). So that meant there were three emperors - French, Austrian and Russian - and only two of them claimed mandate by tradition/religion/whatever. Since then an Emperor was just a really powerful king who had more than one king as a formal or informal subject. That's why *Queen* Victoria of Great Britain was also *Empress* of India - because there were \"kings\" in India over whom she held political power. \n\n ----\n\nEDIT: formatting",

If it passes the vote there then the queen signs off on it and it becomes law. If the Lords reject it then it goes back to the commons and they can change it and try again or ditch it. Any member can submit a bill. It gets three readings and a vote before being sent to the Lords. In the Lords it gets another three readings and a vote before going to the queen.\n\n >  What is the significance of the political parties? What does it matter if somebody is the MP for such and such?\n\nBasically, Labour party is more left-wing (like the US Democrats), Conservatives are more right-wing (like the Republicans) and the Liberal Democrats are somewhere in the middle, but a bit to the left. There are some smaller parties too, mainly nationalist ones from the other countries of the UK, like the SNP (Scotland) and Plaid Cymru (Wales). The MPs are supposed to represent their constituency (which can be a town, or a region of a city) so if I live in Liverpool and think the government should be doing something about our motorway, I can speak to my MP and he can raise the issue in parliament. They are also supposed to represent the feelings of their constituents. If an MPs constituency is largely anti fox hunting, for example, then that should have an impact on whether he votes to ban it or not.\n\nEach constituency elects one MP. If a party has over a certain number of MPs then they automatically form the government and their leader is Prime Minister. If no party reaches that number, then parties have to form a coalition to get a majority and form a government (at the moment there is a coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats).\n\n >  Whats the deal with the budget and the economy?\n\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer (an MP chosen by the Prime Minister, basically) decides the budget each year. This is presented to Parliament as a bill.\n\n >  What are the important decisions that are made and all that jazz?\n\nWell, pretty much the same as the parliament/congress of any other country. They decide on laws, budget and foreign policy. Some lesser powers are devolved to local councils (local taxes, transport, schooling, refuse collection, etc.) and to the parliaments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.",

        "answer": "So chicks can't actually feed themselves for the first week or so. And the day they hatch they aren't the cute fluffy balls you'd expect. However, it is true they seem to mature slightly faster.\n\nI can't seem to find a lot of info on this subject, so I'm going to take what I know about animal behavior and see if we can't make a decent hypothesis.\n\nThe first and most notable difference is that chickens are mainly grounded birds. While capable of flight, they aren't good over long distances. Being on the ground opens you up to a lot more predators than say being high in a tree. Animals that have many predators tend to be able to fend for themselves a little quicker, look at horses or zebras for example. \n\nI can't say I know too much about the reproductive facts of wild chickens, but I wouldn't be surprised to see liver maturation times than domestic chickens due to selective breeding. The faster a chick becomes a chicken, the faster it can produce eggs or be slaughtered.\n\nFinally, and this may seem like the easy way out, it might just be the way chickens evolved. A lot of primates take a very long time to mature, but some species mature much faster. It could just be how their evolution ended up working out.",

        "answer": "He bases his thought not on the perception of earth not being real, but with the impossibility of determining the reality of earth when the human mind is more allured by the purpose, or significance of something within a system, rather than its actual \"realness\" or \"existence\" (as he put, a human emphasis on the **sign** value of an object rather than its **functional** or **exchange** value of an object). It reveals a human's quest for the ideal, that may block true understanding of the world.\n\nDisneyland, for example, emphasizes a more simple, idealistic reality where the nature of things manifest in a manner not tied to realistic restrictions. A shopkeeper in Disneyland, for example, does not make, clean, or organize the merchandise he sells. Factory workers, and people you do not see accomplish that, but when this shopkeeper can devote his entire job to only selling his merchandise and appearing happy, the positive manner in which he portray's his visible **role** in society makes that society seem more appealing, because we are looking at the **sign** value of the shopkeeper, and choose to ignore how he got himself to that position in the shop. He is a simulacrum of a real shopkeeper. (which in reality leads to his fatigue, sadness, or lack of focus, but in Disney is surreptitiously cast aside.)\n\nIn terms of benefits or harms, idealized views of society or people based on their sign value, ie. what they represent, leads to a flawed view of reality. For example, Ronald Reagan represented a suave, calm, and confident American demeanor, one which seemed very optimistic about America's power and future. He is seen as a better leader because people look at that ideal he may have represented, rather than his political views, intelligence, stances, laws, administration, effects on the economy, and foreign policy. Another example is that people look to the past as being ideal, while in reality the flaws and problems with this past overshadows the ideals they represent. Owen Wilson's character in Midnight in Paris eventually overcame this flaw, for he at first dreamed of how much better the past (1920s Paris) was.\n\nIt is a retreating fantasy, within which we can find a certain happiness, for our ideals, the base natures of things which we know to understand, manifest without the endless restriction of reality. Animated films isolate and emphasize features which easily distinguish humans (eyes, characteristics, movements), so that we can connect more easily in this simulated Hyperreality. \n\nThis departure to Hypperreality was Baudrillard's understanding of a human's quest for meaning which often takes a more simple, yet seemingly more encompassing view of reality by seeing an object or idea for what it represents and may imply, rather than its true nature whose manifestation is more complicated, and less fulfilling. \n\n**TL;DR:** Hyperreality is a human's emphasis of focus on what things represent in a system, rather than what they manifest as in reality. This delusion leads to a limited view of the world, which can both harm in its allure, yet provide a respite of comfort and understanding.",

I know these are the big marketing buzzwords these days for carriers, but was wondering what it actually meant here in the US, as I know South Korea for instance has 4G that's apparently WAY better than ours.  What do you ACTUALLY get with 4G and LTE, especially compared to 3G, etc.?  Thanks so much to the experts.",
        "answer": "The first thing you need to understand is that G stands for Generation.  4G isn't the same from country to country because it's just the generation of system they're on.  That's why South Korea has faster data transfer and still calls it the same thing we do in the US.\n\nAs far as the difference between 3G and 4G, 4G is newer, and thus better.  It's like comparing a computer from 2012 to a computer from 1997.  Faster, works better, etc, just because technology has evolved.  Phones that are 4G capable can pick up 3G signal, because they're backwards compatible, like how you can play GameCube games on the Wii even though the Wii is newer.  3G phones can't pick up 4G because it wasn't around when they were programmed, like how you can't play Wii games on a GameCube.\n\nLTE stands for Long Term Evolution.  It's basically trying to make it so as technology evolves and improves your phone can still pick up the faster signal because it won't change much other than by speeding up.  So, it's like if Nintendo came out with another game system, using the LTE system, you'd be able to play those type of games on your Wii and on the new system, but you wouldn't have to buy the new system just to be able to play the games.\n\nEdit: spelling",

Refining plutonium is even harder, because it requires a *nuclear reactor* to do it.\n\nThen, once you've got the fissile material, you have to build a bomb around it.

Get that wrong and the bomb will still go off, but you won't get a nuclear explosion. You'll get a regular old explosion that sprays toxic fissile material around. (Which may be all you're after if you're a crazy person looking to make trouble, but to anybody who's not in that category, that's an unqualified failure.)\n\nThen there's the question of how you deliver the bomb you've built \u2026\u00a0assuming you got that far. See, it's *relatively* easy to build a huge, heavy atomic bomb. (\"Relatively easy\" here meaning \"still incredibly hard, just not as hard as the other stuff we're about to talk about.\") But huge, heavy atomic bombs are, well, *huge* and *heavy!* They can only be delivered by planes, and *gigantic and slow* planes at that. That worked out okay a couple times in the 40s, but that's at play you really only get to run once, because it's trivially easy to defend against if the other guy's even remotely paying attention.\n\nSo instead, the idea is to stick your atomic bomb on top of a rocket. Unlike gigantic, slow planes, rockets are *really* hard to defend against \u2026 but you can't stick a huge, heavy bomb on top of a rocket. To use a rocket to deliver your bomb, you need your bomb to be very small and lightweight. Think large-dog sized, rather than herd-of-elephants sized.\n\nAnd building an atomic bomb that's small and lightweight is *much* harder than building a big, heavy one. Remember when I said the engineering tolerances for a nuclear bomb are very strict? The engineering tolerances for a *missile warhead* are far *more* strict. Because not only do you have to do everything you've already done backwards and in heels, as they say, you have to do it in such a way that the thing can be *shot into space on top of a rocket* and still work when it comes back down!\n\nSo the bottom line is \u2026\u00a0it's hard. It's just an inherently difficult thing to do. It's not *impossible,* clearly, as many people have done it over the years. But it's very difficult nevertheless.",

        "answer": "Yeah. It's a bit of a mind fuck. Quantum mechanics is one of these fields that we can verify with experiments and math to very, very high levels of accuracy but the actual concepts don't compute in our squishy animal brains. It's always possible that there will come a new interpretation of the science that makes more sense, but this has been going on in quantum for about 100 years. Don't jump straight to \"WE CAN PREDICT THE FUTURE\". For many of these situations just because something seems to provide information faster than light it doesn't mean that an observer can get useful info out of it. Let's say that the photon \"knows the future\" a few nanoseconds ahead. Ok, but how long would it take for you to call someone on the other end of the experiment and tell them what you know? Even if you are as fast as the speed of light, you can't beat that other photon as it has a head start... So by the time you dial the other room and say \"THE GATE IS CLOSED\", it's already happened, you're not providing new info. This sort of thing is similar to entanglement thought experiments where two particles are sent to different states/planets/solar systems and changes to one affect the other. It's not really cheating.",

        "answer": "Three operations tend to show up in hash functions: modular addition, bitwise logic, and multiplication by primes.\n\n[Modulo operations](_URL_0_) takes the remainder from division -- for example, 2 goes into 7 three times with a remainder of 1, so `2 mod 7` is 1.\n\nModular addition takes modulo and uses it in addition. Instead of simply adding `A` and `B`, you add `A mod X` and `B mod X`. The result is equivalent to `(A + B) mod X`. This is handy because it creates a sort of \"wrapped\" addition, where the output value will never exceed `X`.\n\nBitwise logic allows you to use 2 or more bits of input to generate 1 bit of output. This is handy if you need to combine chunks of data in a hash. Some example operators include:\n\n* `AND` will output a 1 if all of its inputs are 1, or 0 otherwise\n* `OR` will output a 1 if one or more of its inputs are 1, or 0 otherwise\n* `XOR` will output a 1 if *exactly* one of its inputs is 1, or 0 otherwise\n\nPrime multiplication tends to show up a lot in cryptography, because factoring primes is computationally expensive, which means the operation is theoretically difficult to reverse.\n\nSo... let's say that one round of a hashing algorithm might take the hash output so far, `XOR` two chunks of data together to generate some value `H`, multiply `H` by a big prime number, then use modular addition to add that into its running total. After you do this enough times, you've consumed all of the chunks and generated a hash.\n\nThe precise algorithm is beyond ELI5 level, but you can read about it on Wikipedia, including a [pseudocode example](_URL_1_), if you're really curious.",

It's a branch of the vagus nerve, which has many, many jobs, one of which is in the supply for cough reflexes when parts of the throat are stimulated. In some people, there is some cross-wiring so that when the ear canal is stimulated, the vagus nerve reacts like it's a throat stimulus and they cough.\n\nOther roles of the vagus nerve include parts of the \"rest and digest\" side of the nervous system, the parasympathetic nervous system, such as slowing heart rate, and also in the gag reflex. As a result, some people have significant slowing of the heart when the ear canal is stimulated and can faint or even go into brief asystole (no heart activity). Equally, and more commonly in kids (who any parents will attest can vomit at the drop of a hat), ear canal stimulation can produce gagging or vomiting.",
