This hormone causes hair follicles to become progressively smaller and eventually disappear in a process called miniaturization. Male pattern baldness usually begins with a receding hairline, progresses to baldness on the top of the scalp, and finally leaves only a rim of hair remaining around the sides of the head in a horseshoe pattern. In some cases, however, though a genetic predisposition to baldness exists, it does not manifest itself in hair loss. Other Causes of Baldness As people age, hair gradually thins out and miniaturization naturally",
